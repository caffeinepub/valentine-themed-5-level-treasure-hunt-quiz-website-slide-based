  "summary": "REQ-15 appears implemented via a new SlideTransition wrapper and a timed opacity fade when starting the quiz. REQ-16 has partial evidence of CSS/layout adjustments to prevent text truncation (wrapping and relaxed line-height). REQ-14 (production deployment/publishing failure) is not clearly addressed in the diff; there are references to static assets, but no build/deploy configuration changes are shown to ensure assets are included/served in production or to resolve a publishing error.",

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Investigate and fix the production publishing/deployment error so the app can be successfully built and published to production (including ensuring missing/static assets are included and served correctly).",
      "reason": "The diff shows frontend UI changes and more defensive audio loading, but does not show any concrete change to build/publish/deployment configuration or asset packaging/serving that would resolve a production publishing/deployment error. Referenced assets (/assets/generated/* and /assets/buzz.mp3) are used, but there is no evidence they are now guaranteed to be included in the production build output and served correctly.",
